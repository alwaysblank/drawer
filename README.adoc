== Installation

[source,bash]
----
npm i murmur-drawer
----

== Usage

[source,html]
----
<script type="module">
  import 'murmur-drawer/murmur-drawer.js';
</script>

<murmur-drawer>
  <h2 id="the-drawer">The Drawer</h2>
  <p>Some content.</p>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Tenetur quaerat sint consequuntur. Omnis, totam enim, non reiciendis fugiat quos provident, quisquam eveniet incidunt libero ipsa necessitatibus corrupti dolor fuga accusamus.</p>
</murmur-drawer>
----

This is a very simple module, but it can be used for things like item selection, simple reveals, etc.
It can also be composed together with other drawers to make menus, accordions, etc.

The drawer needs to be able to determine a (relatively) unique id for itself, in order for it to be able to do certain things.
There are several ways you can set this ID:

. An `id` attribute on the heading inside the drawer
. An `id` attribute on the drawer element itself (this overrides #1)
. A `name` attribute on the drawer element itself (this overrides #1 and #2)

=== `icon` Slot

By default the module uses a big "plus" sign to indicate whether the module is open or closed.
If you would like to customize this, you can do so with the `icon` slot:

[source,html]
----
<style>
  .closed, .opened {
    display: none;
  }
  [data-open="false"] .closed {
    display: block;
  }
  [data-open="true"] .opened {
    display: block;
  }
</style>
<murmur-drawer>
  <h2 id="the-drawer">The Drawer</h2>
  <p>Some content.</p>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Tenetur quaerat sint consequuntur. Omnis, totam enim.</p>
  <div slot="icon">
    <span class="opened">üëÜ</span>
    <span class="closed">üëá</span>
  </div>
</murmur-drawer>
----

The slot element will be given a `data-open` attribute that is `false` when the drawer is closed and `true` when open.
Since this is applied to an element in the "light" DOM, you can use a normal stylesheet to control the appearance of elements inside the slot.

== Polyfills

The base module includes no polyfills or transpiling; it's just nice clean ES6 that should work in modern browsers.
Until support for all the required technologies is more universal, we'll probably want to include the following _before_ including the element javascript.
All you need to do is add this:

[source,html]
----
<script
    src="https://unpkg.com/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs@2.3.0/webcomponents-loader.js">
</script>
----

This will load any necessary for base functionality.
Modules extended from this one may require their own polyfills.

== Content

=== heading

This represents the name of the section this drawer contains.
A heading must following a few rules:

. It must be an `h` element (i.e. `h1`, `h3`, etc)
. It must be the first element inside the `<murmur-drawer>`

[WARNING]
While the heading is optional, if no heading is included then the drawer will load closed (i.e. invisible).
Only forgo a heading if you have a plan to open the drawer in some other way (see the `toggle()` method or `open` attribute).

=== content

This is the content the drawer reveals, and is more or less required; Although the drawer will load if no content is defined, there isn't much point.
Any content inside the drawer that is not a heading (as defined above) will be considered content.

[source,html]
----
<murmur-drawer>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
</murmur-drawer>
----

== API

=== Attributes

==== open

Default:: `false`

This represents whether the drawer is open (the attribute is present) or closed (the attribute is not present).
Generally it is set dynamically by the drawer itself based on user interaction, but you can set it manually.

==== headless

Default:: `false`

This attribute is set if the drawer has no heading.
It will be set automatically if the drawer contains no valid heading element, but you can set it manually if, say, you have a `h` element as your first element but don't want it used as the heading.

==== name

Default:: `null`

The drawer will use an id on its heading to do some things, most notably to set a URL that automatically opens the drawer when visited.
If you want to use that functionality but won't be using a heading, then you can set this attribute to whatever you would like to use as an id.

[TIP]
====
If you want to set this via javascript, it is part of the `heading` object:
[source,javascript]
----
document.querySelector(`murmur-drawer`).heading.id = `your-id`
----
====

==== hash

Default:: `false`

If this is enabled, the drawer will set a URL hash when opened, and when visiting that URL it will automatically open the drawer.
Since one of the main use cases for the drawer is for main site navigation, which should never 'start open', this attribute defaults to false.
As a boolean attribute, its presence on the element is enough to activate the feature.

==== controller

Default:: `null`

This attribute allows you to quickly and easily define an element (or elements) that will control the state of this drawer.
Set the value of the attribute to a CSS selector that matches the elements you want to use to control this drawer.
If you have multiple drawers, make sure that their controllers are distinct:
Otherwise you may get some very strange behavior.

Controllers will get a `aria-expanded` attribute to reflect the state of their drawer:
`aria-expanded="true"` when open, `aria-expanded="false"` when closed.

[source,html]
----
<button id="specific-button" aria-expanded="false">Click to Open</button>
<murmur-drawer controller="button#specific-button">
    ...
</murmur-drawer>
----

[TIP]
====
It is recommended that you set `aria-expanded="false"` on your controller manually, so that it has the correct value before instantiation of the module.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
While you can technically use any element as a controller, you should keep two things in mind:

. The module will watch for `click` events on controllers, so use elements that can spawn that event.
. For semantic and interaction reasons, it is _strongly_ recommended that you use `button` elements for your controllers
====

=== CSS

[WARNING]
====
.TODO
Document the rest of the CSS properties.
====

==== Hidden

In some cases it may be useful to redefine what `hidden` means
(i.e. if you want to do something more complex that simply hide/show content).

* `--mod-hidden-display` (`none`) +
This sets the `display` property for `[hidden]` within the drawer.
An example usage might be to set this to `block`, and then change the `opacity` of the parent `murmur-drawer` based on the presence of the `open` attribute there.

=== Methods

==== toggle()

[source,javascript]
----
document.querySelector(`murmur-drawer`).toggle();
----

Calling this method will swap the `open` state of the drawer: If it was open, it will close it, and visa-versa.

=== Events

Each drawer will emit several events when different things happen to it.
These events are used internally to drive the state of the module, but you can also hook into them and implement a lot of additional functionality.

`drawer-opened`::
  This fires when the drawer has opened.
  When this event fires, the drawer is already open.
`drawer-closed`::
  This fires when the drawer has closed.
  When this event fires, the drawer is already closed.
